# Frogger
## Introduciton
The purpose of this project was to create a video game using the assembly x86 language. We decided to 
recreate the classic game Frogger for this project. Frogger is a popular game in which the player controls 
a frog and must navigate through a series of obstacles to reach their goal. The project required us to 
have a solid understanding of the x86 assembly language and its capabilities. We also had to carefully 
plan and design the game mechanics and user interface. In the end, we were able to successfully 
recreate Frogger using x86 assembly language, providing a fun and challenging gaming experience for 
the user. This report will provide an overview of the development process for our Frogger game, 
including the design and implementation of the user guide, program features, and overall structure of 
the program. It will also discuss any challenges we encountered during the development process and 
how we addressed them.
## How to play the game ?
To play our version of Frogger, the user must use the arrow keys on their keyboard to control the 
movement of the frog. The goal of the game is to guide the frog across a busy roadway and a flowing 
river, avoiding obstacles such as cars and using logs to reach the safe side of the map. The game is won 
when the player successfully guides four frogs across the map and into their designated homes at the 
top of the screen. The game will continue till you lose. Each frog that reaches its home will earn the 
player a point. The game is lost if a frog is hit by an obstacle or falls into the water. The player must 
navigate the frog carefully, as the obstacles on the roadway and river move at different speeds and in 
different directions. The game becomes more challenging as the player progresses and the obstacles 
move faster. Overall, the objective of the game is to use strategic planning and quick reflexes to guide 
the frog to safety and earn as many points as possible.
